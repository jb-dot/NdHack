# Neurodiversity Hack
Output from the Neurodiversity Hackathon, hosted by AstraZeneca and supported by Microsoft, Google, NVidia and Intel.

The aim of the Hackathon is to raise awareness around Neurodiversity and provide a source of education for all participants around the variety of challenges that people face.
It's also about leveraging the creativity and enthusiasm of our partisipants to build solutions to help people navigate their daily challenges. 


This repository is to allows us to store code for review at the end of the hack, and then its a great way to presnt those outputs to everyone to utilise and gain benefit from.

When you place your code here, please create a new folder with the number of your team and and the challenge number e.g. Team001_C2 (team 001 challenge 2)
Add a text document with the name of your solution and the names of the participants in your team. Once we've reveiwed all the solutions, we'll rename the folders with the solution names to make it easier for people to look through and find the solutions are relevant to them.
